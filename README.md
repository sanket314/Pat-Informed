# Patent Search Automation - Date Difference Checker

This project is a Selenium-based automation framework developed in Java. It performs a search on a patent search web application, navigates to the search results, and finds the first result box that contains at least two dates (Filing, Publication, or Grant). It then calculates and prints the difference in months and days between the first two available dates.
